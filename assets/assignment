JSON Assignment
50 points - 25 points each
In this project you will need to read from two JSON sources. One from the web and one from
within the project (located in your assets folder). Both must have multiple records.
You have the option of creating two separate apps or one app with two different pages. You can
use the ListTile only once.
You can set up the app with the navigation of your choice.
The app(s) must contain appropriate styling and be suitable to show a potential employer.
